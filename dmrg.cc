dmrg
density matrix renomalization group meathod.
Good at one dimensional problem.
Somewhat useful to solve two dimensional problem.
It might not possible to solve three dimensional problem.
Complementary to Mean-Field Theory favors strong correlated system.
My first goal to be proficient.
From Dr. Miles.
Hope to use this codes to learn not only state-of-the-art DMRG calculation but also DMRG-like machine learning as well as pararell computation.
 Pay my gradtitue and respect to Master.
